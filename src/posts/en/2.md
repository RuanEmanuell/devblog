# What's This Site? What's It For?

Well, in short, this is a project I've wanted to do for a while, and it's a personal blog to talk about topics that interest me, especially about technology and programming.

# But Why Make a Site Instead of Using Something Pre-made?

There are 2 answers to that question:

1 - I really wanted to learn a bit about Next.js, a React framework focused on server-side rendering and generating static websites.
2 - It was more fun than using a pre-made site or something like LinkedIn, for example.

# And Was It Worth It?

It's been about 5 days since I started this project, and I must say yes! I learned a lot about how Next.js works, what I should (and shouldn't) do. Things like how getStaticProps works (which serves for generating static sites, pre-rendering the page), use-server, use-client, and much more.
Due to the use of some dynamic things on this site like language and dark mode, I couldn't use (or at least didn't manage to use) some of the advantages of Next, but I hope to get more accustomed to it in the next projects I make, as the idea of routes made based on project directories, as well as being able to use the advantages of an express server within my own front-end excites me a lot! I can't wait to continue making projects with this and other technologies, and will continue posting more here whenever possible!
