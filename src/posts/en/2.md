# Or die trying....

At the beginning of this week, I was presented with a challenge: to build a website using two technologies that I've used before, but not enough to feel comfortable with: Python and VueJS.
I had used Vue for some small projects some time ago, and I had primarily used Python to solve training questions for the OBI, as it was the language I felt less "fighting with the computer" instead of with the problem. (The total opposite of C!).\
In summary, they were not technologies that I have been practicing daily recently like React and Node, but I thought it would be cool.

# And How Did It Go?

Well, in summary, I didn't deceive myself! It was a very cool project to do. I started with a simple HTML to test the connection with Python. Shortly after, I started working on the backend. Since nothing was defined about the Python framework, I had to choose between the two biggest ones: Django and Flask. After some research, I ended up choosing Flask because it seemed quite simple, but they say Django is also very good, and I definitely want to try it in the future.\
Following Flask's documentation, you can't go wrong, and setting up the basic server is incredibly simple. Python in general really seems like a unique language, where everything is solved with much less "bureaucracy" than in other languages. In a few minutes, I already had a route that returned the necessary JSON for the frontend.

# Vue: Straightforward Front-End

In recent months, I've been quite focused on React, and recently I've been venturing into NextJS as well. Although I'm already used to it, I can't lie that at first, I struggled a lot, especially with React's state. This certainly did not happen with Vue, where everything happens in a way that seems almost "magical," just as I thought it should happen.
Things like "v-for" instead of having to use Object.map or "v-if" and "v-model" are so simple, that they are, in my view, unnecessarily more complex in React. Of course, I love React, but it's undeniable that my experience with Vue was much more comfortable than the first times I used React. My experience with Vue was also very fun, and I hope to have the chance to continue working with it in the near future.

# Development Wraps Up

With the application ready, one part was missing: making the application run automatically when running a shell script. I've been a Linux user for some time, and the application would be tested on a machine running it as well, and for me, there couldn't be anything better than that. Like every Linux user, of course, I already have some experience with terminal commands, but I confess that I never had much experience with shell, and if you don't either, I recommend taking a look, it's very cool to automate the things you do on your PC too, and it's something I really want to explore from now on. With the script ready, I tested it on my machine on Linux Mint, on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 22.04 (I even tested it on the virtual machine twice, at home and on the college PC to make sure everything was running smoothly).

# Conclusion

I had a lot of fun doing this challenge this week, and I really hope I managed to deliver a good result. This seems like a great opportunity and I want to be able to contribute to these people who seem so good in the near future, as well as continue learning more and more. Wish me luck and see you soon!
