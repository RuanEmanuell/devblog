# And why you (probably) should do the same...

It had been a while since I wanted to make this change. But I had been battling with myself, and I confess, I was a little hesitant. After all, I had been on Android for almost 10 years (since 2015!) and I was very accustomed to it. Still, perhaps because of my switch from Windows to Linux, I wanted to give iOS a chance.

# But which?

Well, I wanted a smartphone that fulfilled the following categories:
\
\
1 - Be better than my old Galaxy M32 (performance and cameras)\
2 - Be running the latest iOS at the moment (iOS 17)\
3 - Be as cheap as possible (in case of regret)
\
\
With these requirements, only 3 models really fit: iPhone XR, 11, and SE (2020). \
Among these 3, averaging the prices and analyzing the pros and cons, I chose one.

This is the iPhone XR. Looking at its specifications, there's nothing extraordinary: It's a phone with 3GB of RAM featuring Apple's A12 Bionic hexa-core chip, a 6.1-inch LCD display with a resolution of 828p, a single 12MP F1.9 rear camera, a 7MP F2.2 front camera, along with 128GB of storage and a 2942mAh battery. But it surprised me.

# Unexplainable fluidity and a different experience.

Always been told that iOS seemed more optimized and fluid than Android, but it's the kind of thing you only notice when you use it. On paper, my old phone had better specifications in absolutely every category, but that's not what I noticed while using it. Of course, the A12 Bionic, even though it's an older CPU, was still Apple's flagship in 2018, and that's a factor to consider. That said, I don't think the 2018 Android flagships are performing as well as this smartphone nowadays, let alone having the support it has. I didn't experience any lag or frame drops, whether in day-to-day use or in games. \
The battery also didn't bother me at all, although I did notice a decrease in battery life compared to my old phone (which was expected, considering it had 5000mAh compared to the XR's 3000mAh). As for the screen, although it's a clear downgrade both for being LCD (compared to the M32's AMOLED) and for having a lower resolution, it's not a factor that affected me much, but I understand those who tend to avoid models like the XR and 11 for this reason.

# Camera test

The cameras are another factor that didn't leave me wanting at all, and I felt a significant improvement from my old phone (although, again, if you look at the specifications, theoretically they should be worse). The comparison here will be with the other phone I have at home (Galaxy J8) since the M32 is not available for me to test at any time (and to be honest, the difference between the cameras of the two isn't very significant).

# Development

With an iPhone, you (as a developer) gain 2 things:
\
\
1 - A device running iOS, which can be very useful for testing apps (although you can't generate development builds, that's only possible with a MacOS).

2 - A device with support for Safari, which is great for testing websites in development (since Safari interprets CSS differently from Chrome, and it's always good to keep an eye on that).

# Downsides

Of course, not everything is perfect. Although my experience with the iPhone has been mostly good so far, there are also some caveats to mention.
\
\
1 - There's no back gesture like on Android. This might not seem like a big deal, but it's quite bothersome, especially if you've been an Android user for a long time like I was. The ease of swiping right to go back a page or app screen is something I really miss, but I believe you'll get used to it over time.\
2 - The lack of freedom still bothers me a bit. I was used to doing things like downloading the songs I listened to the most so I could listen to them whenever I wanted, but after a few days on iOS, I was "forced" to buy Spotify Premium to avoid ads.\
3 - The migration from Android to iOS doesn't work as well as you would expect. I've heard great things about migrating from one iOS device to another, but from iOS to Android is a different story. I spent a few hours trying to migrate the data, only to give up and start over from scratch. The upside is that now I have almost all of the 128GB free (at least that's a good thing).

# Conclusion

I don't regret at all having recently migrated to the iPhone. Although (like everything in life) it has its downsides, I believe it's good to give space to new experiences, and if things continue as well as they are going, I believe my next device will also be an iPhone. If an older model like this one is already very good to use, I can't imagine how the newer ones must be. Anyway, thank you for reading this far, and I hope to see you next time!
